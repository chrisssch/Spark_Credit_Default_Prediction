# Predicting Credit Default Rates with Apache Spark

The purpose of this notebook is to practice the basics of transforming data and machine learning in Spark. I implement a simple pipeline for transforming the data and train and evaluate logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models.

The data used is the default of credit card clients data set by Yeh, I. C., & Lien, C. H. (2009) on payment defaults of Taiwenese customers, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Laboratory.
